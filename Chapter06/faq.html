      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>What is the Antediluvian Word Preservation Society?</strong></li>
      <p>The Antediluvian Word Preservation Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting, preserving, and promoting old words that are in danger of becoming overlooked, outmoded, and obsolete. We are a community of word lovers who want to keep these old words alive and relevant.</p>
      <li><strong>Why do you care about old words?</strong></li>
      <p>We care about old words because we believe that words are the building blocks of human communication, culture, and creativity. Words have the power to inspire, inform, and entertain us. Words can also reflect the history, values, and diversity of our society. By preserving old words, we hope to enrich our language and our understanding of the past, present, and future.</p>
      <li><strong>What do you mean by old words?</strong></li>
      <p>By old words, we mean words that are no longer commonly used or recognized in modern English. These words may have fallen out of fashion, become obsolete due to technological or social changes, or simply been replaced by newer or simpler terms. Some examples of old words are: antediluvian (very old or outdated), brabble (to quarrel noisily), cacoethes (an irresistible urge to do something unwise), dudgeon (a feeling of offense or resentment), eftsoons (soon afterward), fribble (a frivolous person or thing), gorgonize (to have a paralyzing or mesmerizing effect), hodiernal (of or relating to the present day), imbroglio (a complicated or embarrassing situation), jocund (cheerful and lighthearted), kenspeckle (easily recognizable or conspicuous), limerence (the state of being infatuated with someone), mumpsimus (a stubborn person who insists on making an error in spite of being shown that it is wrong), nimiety (excess or redundancy), obambulate (to wander about), philomath (a lover of learning), quixotic (exceedingly idealistic or unrealistic), rhapsodic (enthusiastically expressive or ecstatic), sanguine (optimistic or positive), tatterdemalion (a person in ragged clothing).</p>
      <li><strong>How do you protect, preserve, and promote old words?</strong></li>
