        <p>Welcome to the Antediluvian Word Preservation Society, where our goal is to protect, preserve, and promote old words that are in danger of becoming overlooked, outmoded, and obsolete. Stay a while, take a look around, and bask in the burnished sheen of these old and beautiful words.</p>

          <h2>Most recent word</h2>
          <h3><em>hullaballoo</em> (hul·uh·buh·LOO, noun)</h3>
          <p>A great noise or commotion; an uproar. (Example: “After hearing the <strong>hullaballoo</strong> that eight kids hopped up on sugar could make, Rupert decided to never again volunteer to help out at a Halloween party.”) This is a fun word to use in conversation, and it’s perfect if you need an unusual synonym for <em>noise</em> or <em>commotion</em>. It’s just obscure enough that it doesn’t get overused, but it’s not so obscure that most people won’t recognize it and chuckle to themselves. <em>Hullabaloo</em> began its life as the word <em>halloo</em>, meaning “to urge or incite with shouts.” Then, via the process of rhyming reduplication, the <em>balloo</em> part was added to form <em>halloo-balloo</em>, which eventually morphed in <em>hullabaloo</em>. Some synonyms that register about the same on the fun-meter are <em>brouhaha</em>, <em>hubbub</em>, and <em>hurly-burly</em>.</p>

          <h2>This week’s challenge</h2>
          <p>Your challenge this week is to use the word <em>tomfoolery</em> — foolish or silly behavior — at least once in each of the following: in conversation, in an email message, in a text message, and in a business meeting (virtual or real-world). Good luck and let us know how you make out!
