      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Antediluvian Word Preservation Society, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting, preserving, and promoting old words that are in danger of becoming overlooked, outmoded, and obsolete.</p>
      <p>We believe that words are the building blocks of human communication, culture, and creativity. Words have the power to inspire, inform, and entertain us. Words can also reflect the history, values, and diversity of our society.</p>
      <p>However, not all words are equally valued or used in our modern world. Some words are fading away from our collective memory and vocabulary, either because they are too archaic, obscure, or complex for everyday use. These words are at risk of being forgotten or lost forever.</p>
      <p>That's why we created the Antediluvian Word Preservation Society, a community of word lovers who want to keep these old words alive and relevant. We do this by:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Protecting</strong>: We collect and document old words from various sources, such as dictionaries, books, newspapers, and oral traditions. We also research the origins, meanings, and usage of these words over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Preserving</strong>: We store and archive old words in our online database, which is accessible to anyone who is interested in learning more about them. We also create and share digital and physical materials that feature these words, such as podcasts, newsletters, posters, and stickers.</li>
      <li><strong>Promoting</strong>: We encourage and support the use of old words in various contexts and platforms, such as social media, blogs, podcasts, games, and art. We also organize and participate in events and activities that celebrate these words, such as word-of-the-day challenges, quizzes, contests, and workshops.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our goal is to raise awareness and appreciation for old words among the general public, as well as to foster a sense of curiosity and wonder for the richness and diversity of language.</p>
      <p>If you share our passion for old words and want to join our mission, please contact us or follow us on our social media accounts. We would love to hear from you and welcome you to our society.</p>
      <p>Together, we can make sure that no word is left behind.</p>
