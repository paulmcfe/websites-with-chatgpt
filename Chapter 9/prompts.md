# Recipe page prompt
```
I want to build a web page for a recipe. I don’t know how to code, so I need you to provide the code for me.

First, write the HTML code for a web page that includes the following:
 * A header element that includes an image named super-baker.png, the title "The Super Baker", and the tagline "The ultimate guide to super-powered baking. Learn how to make delicious treats that will boost your energy, strength, and speed.".
 * A main section with the heading "Super-Energy Nut Bars".
 * A paragraph with the text "Looking for an energy boost, either first thing in the morning or during that mid-afternoon lull? Look no further than these tasty and nutritious nut bars, which turn the energy dial up to 11. Packed full of delicious and take-you-all-the-way-to-dinner nuts and dried fruit, all combined with a give-me-energy-now hit of honey and maple syrup, these bars just might be the perfect superhero snack."
  * Add the third-level heading "Dry Ingredients" followed by a bulleted list with the following items:
    -200g rolled oats
    -100g peanuts
    -100g almonds
    -50g pumpkin seeds
    -50g sesame seeds
    -100g dates or other dried fruit
  * Add the third-level heading "Wet Ingredients" followed by a bulleted list with the following items:
    -120g honey
    -80g maple syrup
    -1 tsp vanilla extract
    -¼ tsp sea salt
  * Add the third-level heading "Preparation" followed by a numbered list with the following items:
    -Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place one rack on the bottom shelf and another rack in the middle.
    -Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper.
    -Spread out the nuts and seeds evenly on one baking sheet.
    -Spread out the rolled oats evenly on the other baking sheet.
    -Place the nuts and seeds on the bottom rack and the oats on the middle rack.
    -Bake for 8 minutes, then remove the nuts and seeds; continue baking the oats for another 7 minutes. 
    -Allow the oats, nuts, and seeds to cool. (Don't throw out the parchment paper sheets.)
    -Chop the cooled nuts.
    -Chop the dates.
    -Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl.
    -Prepare an 8x10 or 7x11 pan:
     -Line the pan with one of the sheets of parchment paper from the bake.
     -Coat the parchment paper with oil (such as sunflower oil).
     -Oil one side of the other sheet of parchment paper.
    -Add the wet ingredients to a small saucepan.
    -Cook the wet ingredients on the stovetop, stirring constantly, until a quick-read thermometer inserted into the liquid reads 260°F.
    -Add to cooked liquid to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.
    -Add the mixture to the prepared pan.
    -Place the oiled side of the second sheet of parchment paper down on the mixture and use a spoon and/or potato masher to press the mixture into place.
    -Cool the mixture in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.
    -Remove from the fridge and let sit for 30-60 minutes. (You want the mixture to be warm enough that it doesn't shatter when you try to cut it.)
    -Cut into 24 pieces.
  * A footer element that includes the Copyright symbol, followed by the current year, followed by "The Super Baker".
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta charset="utf-8">.

Second, in a separate file write the CSS code for the following:
 * The page has background color azure, a 24px margin, and a line height of 1.5.
 * The header has text color darkred and 12px padding.
 * Make the header image a maximum width of 250px and floated to the left.
 * The title is 48px, centered, and with no bottom margin.
 * The tagline is 26px, italic, centered, and with no top margin.
 * The main section has a top margin of 75px.
 * The main section heading font size is 30px.
 * The main section font size is 20px.
 * For the page headings, use the Merriweather Sans font from Google Fonts. For the page text, use the Merriweather font from Google Fonts.
 * For the nested numbered list, use lower roman numerals.
 * The footer has 5px padding all around, 50px top margin, and a darkred top border.
 * Give the page a maximum width of 800px and center the body element within the browser window.
