I want to build a web page for a photo gallery. I don’t know how to code, so I need you to provide the code for me.

First, write the HTML code for a web page that includes the following:
 * A header element that includes an image named logo.png, which is stored in the "images" subdirectory, and the title "Cover Me Book Design".
 * A main section with the heading "My Latest Book Designs".
 * A container with six UI cards, each of which has an image at the top, followed by a second-level heading, followed by some text. Here are the specifics for each of the six cards:
   * Card 1: The image portfolio01.jpg in the images subfolder; the heading "I Fell In Love with ChatGPT"; the text "I designed this book for Moughton-Hifflin’s new line of AI-themed romance books."
   * Card 2: The image portfolio02.jpg in the images subfolder; the heading "The Shakespeare Time Machine"; the text "Maggie O'Farrell meets H.G. Wells in this historical fiction book I designed for Juxtaposition Publishing."
   * Card 3: The image portfolio03.jpg in the images subfolder; the heading "Our New ChatBot Overlords"; the text "A dystopian AI future awaits us all in this science fiction title I designed for H. J. Simpson Press."
   * Card 4: The image portfolio04.jpg in the images subfolder; the heading "Yo, Yossarian!"; the text "A biography of the character John Yossarian from Joseph Heller’s novel Catch-22; designed for Hyperbole Editions."
   * Card 5: The image portfolio05.jpg in the images subfolder; the heading "The Mystery of the Missing Sock"; the text "A perennial mystery gets solved in this whodunit, which I designed for The Butler Did It Publications."
   * Card 6: The image portfolio06.jpg in the images subfolder; the heading "The Old Person's Guide to TikTok"; the text "I designed the cover of this TikTok how-to guide for Old People Are People, Too Press."
 * A footer element that includes the Copyright symbol, followed by "Cover Me Book Design".
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta charset="utf-8">.
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">.

Second, in a separate file write the CSS code for the following:
 * The page has background color mintcream and no margin.
 * The page text uses font size 20px and the Nunito font from Google Fonts.
 * The header has background color coral and 24px padding.
 * Make the header a Flexbox row container with centered content and allow the content to wrap.
 * The title is 64px, uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts, and has 16px padding on the left.
 * The main section has centered text and a 24px margin.
 * The main section heading has font size 30px and uses the Poppins font from Google Fonts.
 * Make the portfolio a Flexbox container. Enable the content to wrap and add a gap between items of 16px.
 * Give each card a minimum width of 200px and a maximum width of 350px.
 * For each card image, make sure there is no margin or padding around the image so that it extends all the way to the top, left, and right edges of the card.
 * Add 16px padding to the left and right of the card text.
 * Style the cards with a drop-shadow where both the x and y offset are 8px, the blur is 4px, and the transparency is 0.3.
 * Style the cards with a border radius of 20px.
 * The footer has background color coral, 16px padding, and centered text.
