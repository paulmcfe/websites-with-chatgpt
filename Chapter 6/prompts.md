# Home page prompt
```
I want to build a home page for an information website. I don’t know how to code, so I need you to provide the code for me.

First, write the HTML code for a web page that includes the following:
 * The page title is "Antediluvian Word Preservation Society".
 * A header that includes the title "Antediluvian Word Preservation Society" and the tagline "Preserving words from the past, for the future".
 * After the header, a navigation element that includes five links:
   * The text "Home" that links to the file "index.html".
   * The text "Blog" that links to the file "blog.html".
   * The text "FAQ" that links to the file "faq.html".
   * The text "About" that links to the file "about.html".
   * The text "Contact" that links to the file "contact.html".
 * A main element that includes the following:
   * An introductory paragraph that includes the text "Welcome to the Antediluvian Word Preservation Society, where our goal is to protect, preserve, and promote old words that are in danger of becoming overlooked, outmoded, and obsolete. Stay a while, take a look around, and bask in the burnished sheen of these old and beautiful words."
  * A section element with the second-level heading "Most recent word", followed by a third-level heading with the text "*hullaballoo* (hul·uh·buh·LOO, noun)", followed by a paragraph that includes the text "A great noise or commotion; an uproar. (Example: “After hearing the **hullaballoo** that eight kids hopped up on sugar could make, Rupert decided to never again volunteer to help out at a Halloween party.”) This is a fun word to use in conversation, and it’s perfect if you need an unusual synonym for *noise* or *commotion*. It’s just obscure enough that it doesn’t get overused, but it’s not so obscure that most people won’t recognize it and chuckle to themselves. *Hullabaloo* began its life as the word *halloo*, meaning “to urge or incite with shouts.” Then, via the process of rhyming reduplication, the *balloo* part was added to form *halloo-balloo*, which eventually morphed in *hullabaloo*. Some synonyms that register about the same on the fun-meter are *brouhaha*, *hubbub*, and *hurly-burly*.
  * Another section element with the second-level heading "This week’s challenge" followed by a paragraph that includes the text "Your challenge this week is to use the word *tomfollery* — foolish or silly behavior — at least once in each of the following: in conversation, in an email message, in a text message, and in a business meeting (virtual or real-world). Good luck and let us know how you make out!
  * In the above text, make each word that's surrounded by double asterisks bold, and make each word that's surrounded by single asterisks italic. 
 * A footer element that includes the Copyright symbol, followed by the current year, followed by "Antediluvian Word Preservation Society".
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta charset="utf-8">.

Second, in a separate file write the CSS code for the following:
 * The body element has 25px padding and a background color of oldlace.
 * Make the title 64px, line height 1, color midnightblue, 20px bottom margin, and the Playfair Display typeface from Google Fonts.
 * Make the tagline font size 30px.
 * The navigation element has a top and bottom border colored midnightblue.
 * The navigation element has 20px top and bottom border and 10px top and bottom padding.
 * Style the navigation links with font size 24px;
 * Space the navigation links so that they span the entire width of the body.
 * Style the second-level headings with size 48px, 30px top margin, 10px bottom margin, the color midnightblue, and the Playfair Display typeface from Google Fonts.
 * Style the rest of the page text with size 24px, the color darkslategray, an 8px top margin, and the Lora typeface from Google Fonts.
 * Style the links with the color steelblue and no underline.
 * The footer has 10px top and bottom padding, a 50px top margin, and a top and bottom border colored midnightblue.
 * The page has a maximum width of 800px and is centered within the browser window.
