        <p>Welcome to the Antediluvian Word Preservation Society's blog. Here are the latest entries:

      <h2>hullaballoo</h2>
      <h3> (hul·uh·buh·LOO, noun) — posted August 14</h3>
      <p>A great noise or commotion; an uproar. (Example: “After hearing the <strong>hullaballoo</strong> that eight kids hopped up on sugar could make, Rupert decided to never again volunteer to help out at a Halloween party.”) This is a fun word to use in conversation, and it’s perfect if you need an unusual synonym for <em>noise</em> or <em>commotion</em>. It’s just obscure enough that it doesn’t get overused, but it’s not so obscure that most people won’t recognize it and chuckle to themselves. <em>Hullabaloo</em> began its life as the word <em>halloo</em>, meaning “to urge or incite with shouts.” Then, via the process of rhyming reduplication, the <em>balloo</em> part was added to form <em>halloo-balloo</em>, which eventually morphed in <em>hullabaloo</em>. Some synonyms that register about the same on the fun-meter are <em>brouhaha</em>, <em>hubbub</em>, and <em>hurly-burly</em>.</p>

        <h2>codswallop</h2>
        <h3>(KODZ·wol·up, noun) — posted August 7</h3>
        <p>Nonsense, rubbish, or drivel; also <em>cod’s wallop and cod’s</em>em>. (Example: “The old story about alligators in the sewers of New York City is nothing but a load of <strong>codswallop</strong>!”) No one has any idea where this word came from. The tale most often told concerns a gentleman named Hiram C. Codd, who sold bottled lemonade in England in the 1870s. In those days, <em>wallop</em> was a slang term for an alcoholic drink, especially beer, so “Codd’s wallop” became a sarcastic reference to any weak drink, and then to anything of little or no value. Of course, it's entirely possible that this story is itself just a load of codswallop! If you don't want to use codswallop, but you're still in the mood for making ironic use of an old-fashioned sounding word, try <em>balderdash</em> (BAWL·dur·dash), <em>flapdoodle</em> (FLAP·doo·dul), or <em>horsefeathers</em> (HORS·feth·urs, "th" as in "the").

        <h2>flibbertigibbet</h2>
        <h3>(FLIB·ur·tee·jib·it, noun) — posted July 31</h3>
        <p>A silly, irresponsible, flighty person, especially one who chatters constantly. (Example: “After listening to Muriel jabber mindlessly for ten minutes, Macon realized he was dealing with a real <strong>flibbertigibbet</strong>.”) The origin of this word is obscure, but the Oxford English Dictionary speculates that it’s an imitation of the sound of idle, trivial chatter. That makes it <em>onomatopoeic</em> (on·uh·mat·uh·PEE·ik, adj.), which describes a word formed from the imitation of the sound associated with the thing or action it refers to. This approach has produced dozens of English words, including <em>splash</em>, <em>buzz</em>, <em>murmur</em>, <em>meow</em>, <em>chirp</em>, <em>hiss</em>, <em>sizzle</em>, and <em>cock-a-doodle-do</em>. Onomatopoeia (the process; pronounced on·uh·mat·uh·PEE·uh) is also responsible for two other terms that deal with idle chatter: <em>babble</em> and <em>yadda yadda yadda</em>. Here are a few other fun words you can use instead of <em>flibbertigibbet</em>: <em>scatterbrain</em>, <em>birdbrain</em>, <em>featherbrain</em>, <em>dingbat</em>, <em>rattle-head</em>, and <em>giddy-head</em>.

        <h2>galoot</h2>
        <h3>(guh·LOOT, noun) — posted August 24</h3>
        <p>A clumsy, uncouth, and not overly smart person. (Example: “Some big, dumb fool kept knocking into me on the subway this morning. I think they need a ‘No <strong>Galoots</strong>’ policy during rush hour.”) Somewhere back in the shrouded mists of movie history, a leading lady called John Wayne or Clark Gable or some other leading man a “big galoot,” and the word stuck. (Actually, the words “big” and “galoot” have been used together so often that it now seems wrong to apply <em>galoot</em> to a small person.) These days, you’re more likely to hear people use a dull synonym such as <em>oaf</em>, but another fun word that I like is <em>clodhopper</em>.
