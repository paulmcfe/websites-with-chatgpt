            <li>80g maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ tsp sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place one rack on the bottom
                 shelf and another rack in the middle.</li>
            <li>Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spread out the nuts and seeds evenly on one baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread out the rolled oats evenly on the other baking 
                sheet.</li>
            <li>Place the nuts and seeds on the bottom rack and the oats on 
                the middle rack.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8 minutes, then remove the nuts and seeds; continue 
                baking the oats for another 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the oats, nuts, and seeds to cool. (Don't throw out the 
                parchment paper sheets.)</li>
            <li>Chop the cooled nuts.</li>
            <li>Chop the dates.</li>
            <li>Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Prepare an 8x10 or 7x11 pan:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Line the pan with one of the sheets of parchment paper 
                    from the bake.</li>
                <li>Coat the parchment paper with oil (such as sunflower 
                    oil).</li>
                <li>Oil one side of the other sheet of parchment paper.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Add the wet ingredients to a small saucepan.</li>
            <li>Cook the wet ingredients on the stovetop, stirring constantly, 
                until a quick-read thermometer inserted into the liquid reads 
                260°F.</li>
            <li>Add to cooked liquid to the dry ingredients and mix 
                thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add the mixture to the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Place the oiled side of the second sheet of parchment paper 
                down on the mixture and use a spoon and/or potato masher to 
                press the mixture into place.</li>
            <li>Cool the mixture in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge and let sit for 30-60 minutes. (You 
                want the mixture to be warm enough that it doesn't shatter 
                when you try to cut it.)</li>
            <li>Cut into 24 pieces.</li>
        </ol>
