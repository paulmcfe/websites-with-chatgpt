```
Create the HTML and CSS code that renders the following text as a paragraph with a dark red drop cap: "Starting an article doesn’t have to be boring! Get your text off to a great beginning by rocking the opening paragraph with a giant first letter. You can use either a <i>raised cap</i> (also called a <i>stick-up cap</i> or simply an <i>initial</i>) that sits on the baseline, or you can use a <i>drop cap</i> that sits below the baseline and nestles into the text."
```

# Article page prompt
```
I want to build a web page for an article. I don’t know how to code, so I need you to provide the code for me.

First, write the HTML code for a web page that includes the following:
 * A header element that includes an image named logo.png, which is stored in the "images" subdirectory, the site title "Dream Vacations" and the site tagline "Travel guides to imaginary places".
 * A navigation element that includes the following links:
  * Home (links to index.html)
  * Sci-Fi (links to sci-fi.html)
  * Fantasy (links to fantasy.html)
  * Children’s (links to childrens.html)
  * Literary (links to literary.html)
 * A main section that contains an article element and an aside element.
 * The article element title is the second-level heading "Travel Guide to Narnia".
 * The aside element title is the third-level heading "Related Guides".
 * A footer element that includes the Copyright symbol, followed by "Dream Vacations, LLC".
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta charset="utf-8">.
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">.

Second, in a separate file write the CSS code for the following:
 * The page text uses font size 20px and the Baskerville font from Google Fonts.
 * The header has background color lightblue and 24px padding.
 * The site title is 64px and uses the Raleway font from Google Fonts.
 * The site tagline is 32px and uses the Raleway font from Google Fonts.
 * The second-level heading is 36px and uses the Raleway font from Google Fonts.
 * The third-level headings are 24px and use the Raleway font from Google Fonts.
 * The article title and the aside title have a 10px top margin.
 * The aside has a 1px, solid, lightblue border.
 * The nav, article, aside, and footer elements have 10px padding.
 * The footer has a 1px, lightblue top border and a 10px top margin.
 * The page has a maximum width of 800px and is centered within the browser window.
 * Style all links with color midnightblue and no underline.
 * Lay out the page as follows:
  * The header is a two-column CSS Grid container with the logo in the left column and the site title and tagline in the right column.
  * The navigation bar is a row Flexbox container.
  * The main element is a two-column CSS Grid container; the article element column is twice the width of the aside element column; there is a gap of 10px between the columns.
 * For screens with width less than or equal to 500px, do the following:
  * Convert each two-column grid into a one-column grid.
  * Make the site title 40px and the site tagline 24px.
  * Give the site logo a maximum width of 150px.
  * Center the header content.
