            Welcome to Bread in the Bone, where I, a bread baker, a
            bread eater, and an unabashed bread nerd, try to make 
            sense of the historical, cultural, and linguistic 
            significance of that most humble of home staples: the loaf 
            of bread. It's the greatest thing since, well, you know...

        <p>This site is divided into three sections:</p>

        <section>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                A potted and probably not very accurate history of 
                bread, from its ancient origins to todayâ€™s ancient 
                grains. <a href="history.html">Check it out.</a>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>
                A remarkably shallow examination of the cultural 
                significance of bread, from its religious meanings 
                to its social uses. <a href="culture.html">Read it.</a>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Language</h2>
            <p>
                A not-all-that-deep dive into the linguistic roots 
                of bread, from its etymology to its varied metaphors.
