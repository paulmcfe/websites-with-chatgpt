# Online journal web page prompt

I want to build a web page for an online journal. I donâ€™t know how to code, so I need you to provide the code for me.

First, write the HTML code for a web page that includes the following:
 * A header element that includes an image named [logo filename], the title "[page title]", and the tagline "[page tagline]".
 * A main section where each entry is an accordion using the HTML summary and details elements.
 * For each entry, the summary text is the entry title and the details include the entry date, followed by the entry text.
 * Please provide four sample entries going back four days from today.
 * A footer element that includes the Copyright symbol, followed by the current year, followed by "[your name]".
 * In the page head section, include the tag <meta charset="utf-8">.

Second, in a separate file write the CSS code for the following:
 * The page background color is mintcream.
 * The page text color is slategray.
 * Make the image a maximum width of 150px and floated to the left.
 * The title font size is 48px.
 * The tagline font size is 22px and formatted as italic.
 * The summary font size is 30px.
 * The main section font size is 20px with a top margin of 48px.
 * Make the date of each entry dark blue with font size 18px.
 * For the headings and summary text, use the Lato font from Google Fonts. For the rest of the text, use the Merriweather font from Google Fonts.
 * The footer has 5px padding all around and a 10px top margin.
 * Make the page responsive with a maximum width of 850px.
 * Style the accordions to make them look nicer, including a powderblue background color.
